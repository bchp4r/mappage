"As an example, the migrant community of Ecuador is concentrated in areas such as Queens-New York, due to the familiarity and relationship that has already been built through decades among Ecuadorians that have already arrived in the area," says Linda Machuca, General Consul of Ecuador in New York. "Networks of solidarity are formed between families, friends and countrymen. Whoever arrived before welcomes the newcomer, such as your family member, friend or neighbor to the neighborhood. Then he recommends a job, often they share the house with this person, until he or she can move into a house nearby. "

The current job expansion helps immigrant economie, Maria Fernanda Baquerizo, 35, works at the Ecuadorian Consulate and is a Member of the Ecuadorian Women’s Network. “Ecuadorians have historically been forced to immigrate, for economic reasons,” said Baquerizo, “we come in search of job opportunities, due, for example, to the financial crisis of 1999.”<br>

According to the Center for Latin American, Caribbean, and Latino Studies at CUNY, until 2016 the Ecuadorian population was the largest ethnicity, representing 26% of the total Latino population in Queens Community District #3, second only to the Mexican population which represented 25%. Ecuadorians represented the largest foreign-born population at 78%. 

This trend has been shaping the economic and cultural profile of the region. 
.<br>"The unemployment rate for immigrants was below the citywide rate in 2017." According to The Office Of The New York Comptroller. "Four boroughs outside of Manhattan have contributed 48 percent of the job gains since the end of the recession, the largest share since at least 1975. In 2018, the outer boroughs accounted for 60 percent of citywide job gains."

			<img src="images/burning5.png">	  After five years of photographing this unique community, I have come to understand the concept of radical inclusion, all are welcome and accepted at Black Rock. In the world of "Burning Man" I observed and captured colorful citizens, loving and open people, sunrises, sunsets, landscapes natural and man-made, all presenting an alternative world, an experiment free of religious ties, bureaucratic border patrols, political barriers, conspicuous consumerism, where all are welcome. It is a world in which we are each different, but interdependent, where we need much less than what we have to survive with dignity. Black Rock offers a refuge, an awakening in which we can educate, dance, create and be happy without losing sight of what really matters, life in freedom with others.</div></div> -->
